# Evaluation Results

Results are recorded here as each module from CLAUDE.md Section 12's testing
table is verified. This feeds the proposal's required Testing & Evaluation
deliverable.

## Person Detection (Phase 1, step 1)

**Module:** `backend/app/ai/prototypes/person_detection.py` — YOLOv8n
(pretrained, COCO weights), person class only, configurable confidence
threshold (default 0.5).

**Test 1 — logic validation on known images** (`ultralytics` bundled
assets, not part of the actual deliverable, just a sanity check before
hardware testing):
- `bus.jpg` (3 visible people): 3/3 detected, confidences 0.83-0.87.
- `zidane.jpg` (2 visible people): 2/2 detected.
- Bounding boxes tight around each person, no false positives on the bus
  or background.

**Test 2 — recorded test clip** (6s, captured from the team's own
webcam, 170 frames, CPU inference):
- Person detected in every sampled frame (frames 0, 20, 40, ..., 160).
- Confidence stable: 0.88-0.89 across sampled frames.
- Bounding box stable (no jitter/drift) across the clip.
- Throughput: 170 frames in 28.4s -> **avg 6.0 FPS end-to-end** (capture +
  inference, CPU only, YOLOv8n).

**Test 3 — live webcam** (80 frames, direct `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`):
- Person detected consistently, confidence up to 0.94.
- Bounding box stable across sampled frames.
- Throughput: 80 frames in 18.5s -> **avg 4.3 FPS end-to-end**; inference-only
  step (model.predict call, excluding frame capture/display overhead)
  measured ~7.5 FPS.

**Notes:**
- All inference above ran on CPU (no GPU used). FPS numbers will improve
  with a GPU or a smaller/quantized model if real-time performance becomes
  a bottleneck once this is wired into the multi-camera backend pipeline.
- Confidence threshold, model weights path, and source (webcam index or
  video file) are all CLI-configurable, not hardcoded, per Section 11's
  coding standards.

**Verdict:** PASS — bounding boxes are stable on both a recorded clip and
live webcam, per Section 12's testing requirement for this module.
